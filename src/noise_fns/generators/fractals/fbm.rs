/// Noise function that outputs fBm (fractal Brownian motion) noise.

/// fBm is a _monofractal_ method. In essence, fBm has a _constant_ fractal
/// dimension. It is as close to statistically _homogeneous_ and _isotropic_
/// as possible. Homogeneous means "the same everywhere" and isotropic means
/// "the same in all directions" (note that the two do not mean the same
/// thing).
///
/// The main difference between fractal Brownian motion and regular Brownian
/// motion is that while the increments in Brownian motion are independent,
/// the increments in fractal Brownian motion depend on the previous increment.
///
/// fBm is the result of several noise functions of ever-increasing frequency
/// and ever-decreasing amplitude.
///
/// fBm is commonly referred to as Perlin noise.
